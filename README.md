# Credit Risk Evaluator

This exercise takes a dataset of house loans from the full year of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 and uses the 2019 data to train machine learning models and 2020 to test them. Two models are attempted, a linear regression and a random forest classification. Both of these models are run first on un-scaled data, and then on scaled data.
